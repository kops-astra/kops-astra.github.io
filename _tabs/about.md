Hey, I’m a firmware engineer who loves living at the edge—right where hardware meets software. With over decade of extensive experience in embedded firmware development, I build the brains behind embedded devices, writing code that runs on bare metal or real-time operating systems to make things smart, responsive, and rock-solid reliable.

Whether it’s bringing up new boards, fine-tuning drivers, optimizing memory footprints, or debugging at the register level, I’m all about precision, performance, and pushing the limits of what embedded systems can do.

I’ve worked with MCUs from ARM Cortex-M to ESP32, written linker scripts, tamed bootloaders, and built production-grade firmware that ships in real products. When I’m not coding in C or elbow-deep in oscilloscope readings, I’m probably out riding my motorcycle, exploring new terrains or just enjoying a cricket match with my friends.

Who knows where life will take me. But I know wherever I am, I'll be creating.
